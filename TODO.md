# Socket.IO Connection Fix

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Created proxy.conf.json to proxy /socket.io/* and /api/* requests to localhost:3000
- [x] Updated angular.json to use proxy configuration for serve command
- [x] Updated environment.ts to use relative socket server URL (empty string)

## Next Steps
- [ ] Restart Angular dev server with `ng serve` to apply proxy configuration
- [ ] Ensure backend socket.io server is running on localhost:3000
- [ ] Test socket.io connection in admin-chat component
- [ ] If issues persist, check backend server logs for CORS or version compatibility issues
